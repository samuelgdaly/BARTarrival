# BART Data (lines.json, stations.json)

Edit these JSON files to customize names shown in the app vs. the BART API:

- **stations.json** – `displayName` controls how each station appears (e.g., "12th St. Oakland" instead of "12th St. Oakland City Center")
- **lines.json** – `displayName` controls line labels (e.g., "SFO Airport" instead of "Millbrae")

Keep `code` and `apiName` in sync with the BART API; only change `displayName` for display.
